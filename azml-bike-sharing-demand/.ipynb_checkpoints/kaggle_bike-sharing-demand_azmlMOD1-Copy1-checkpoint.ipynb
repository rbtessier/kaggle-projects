    "# Running Kaggle Bike Sharing using Azure ML\n",
    "Here I'm trying to apply what I've learned from the Azure DP 100 training LP 2 MODs 1-3 on doing ML and storing data in Azure ML Service. I've taken a model I've trained to predict bicycle rental counts per hour for a Kaggle learning competition on bike demand. I was applying knowledge I learned in a book called principles of Data Science in that I learned how to split nominal columns into dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I'm doing this with my local JupyterLab, this is also a test of using the Azure ML Python SDK on my local machine - and not on the notebooks provided by the ```myCIWorkstateionRyan``` Compute Instance. Apparently I can store notebooks independently in workspace storage and open them in any VM - so I suspect I can get these files from here as well, I will have to look into that!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps next I will try to finish what I've started with house price prediction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this experiment, I'll use what was learned in MOD 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Update at 4:21 July 29: After all day of working with this, when I plug my test data into my model, I get ridiculous things. I'm trying to debug but its hard to get the script to do anything since the compute runs on a container. I'm thinking I need to double check my dataset first.\n"

Note that the default environment for this estimator does not include the **scikit-learn** package, so you need to explicitly add that to the configuration. The conda environment is built on-demand the first time the estimator is used, and cached for future runs that use the same configuration; so the first run will take a little longer. On subsequent runs, the cached environment can be re-used so they'll complete more quickly.\n",
